The goal of this assignment is to do text classification on social media,
sorting them into different classes.  We'll be using the logistic regression
classifier provided by *sklearn*.

Unlike previous assignments, the code provided with this assignment has all of
the functionality required.  Your job is to make the functionality better by
improving the features the code uses for text classification.
